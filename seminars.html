<span><p>Billions of people use browsers to access the web from a variety of devices, but it remains difficult to write and debug the client-side of web applications. The browser exposes unfamiliar, redundant, and incompatible abstractions for a variety of common tasks, preventing developers from adapting existing code written for other platforms. The browser environment is completely event-driven and pervasively concurrent, resulting in complex control flow and race conditions that are difficult to debug.</p><p>In this talk, I will describe how my research makes it easier to write and debug web applications. Doppio is a JavaScript runtime system that lets developers run unaltered code written in general-purpose languages, such as Java and C/C++, directly inside the browser. Browsix further enhances Doppio with a kernel, processes, and shared operating system resources, letting multiple off-the-shelf programs concurrently interoperate on the same webpage. ReJS is a low-overhead and high-fidelity time-traveling debugger that lets developers instantaneously step forward and backward through a program's execution. ReJS accurately recreates the application's complete behavior, including the GUI and multiple types of race conditions, while producing miniscule and portable application traces. These resources transform the browser into a first-class application platform.</p></span></p>

<span><p>It has long been noted that research on contracts and gradual typing bears a striking resemblance to Dana Scott's work on retracts in domain theory. However, a concrete relationship has been elusive, especially since the notion of *blame* has seemingly no counterpart in domain theory.</p><p>We connect these fields by means of gradual type precision, which has been characterized previously using blame in [1]. We propose a definition in terms of section-retraction pairs, allowing us to relate blame and retractions in a precise way. Our definition agrees with [1] on most rules, but differs in a way that suggests a modification to their definition of blame.</p><p>[1] Wadler and Findler, Well-typed Programs can't Be Blamed:

<div class="pn-abstract-bio"><p><span class="pn-title-2">Abstract</span>
<span><p>The simply-typed λ-calculus, with only function types, is strongly normalizing, and its program equivalence relation is decidable: unlike in more advanced type system with polymorphism or effects, the natural &quot;syntactic&quot; equivalence (βη-equivalence) corresponds to natural &quot;semantic&quot; equivalence (observational or contextual equivalence), and is decidable. Adding product types (pairs) is easy and preserves these properties, but sums (disjoint unions) are, surprisingly, harder. It is only in 1995 that Neil Ghani proved that the equivalence in presence of sums is decidable, and the situation in presence of the empty type (zero-ary sum) was unknown.</p><p>We propose an equivalence algorithm for sums and the empty type that takes inspiration from a proof-theoretic technique, named &quot;focusing&quot;,designed for proof search. The exposition will be introductory; I will present the difficulties caused by sums and the empty type, present some of the existing approaches for sums in the literature, introduce focusing, and give a high-level intuition of our saturation-based algorithm and its termination argument. No previous knowledge of focusing is assumed. I expect some familiarity with typed lambda-calculi, but will recall all concepts used (for example, βη-equivalence) during the talk.</p></span></p>

intuition.</p></span></p></div></div><br /><div id="seminar-4" class="col-md-12 pn-seminar"><script type="text/javascript">

<span><p>Hybrid apps help developers build multiple apps for different platforms with less duplicated effort, by providing platform-specific functionality via native code and user interactions via javascript code. however, most hybrid apps are developed in multiple programming languages with different semantics, complicating programming. moreover, untrusted javascript code may access device-specific features via native code, exposing hybrid apps to attacks. Unfortunately, there are no existing tools to detect such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present HybriDroid, the first static analysis framework for Android hybrid apps. First, we investigate the semantics of interoperation of Android Java and JavaScript. Then, we design and implement a static analysis framework that analyzes inter-communication between Android Java and JavaScript. We demonstrate HybriDroid with a bug detector that identifies programmer errors due to the hybrid semantics, and a taint analyzer that finds information leaks cross language boundaries. Our empirical evaluation shows that the tools are practically usable in that they found previously uncovered bugs in real-world Android hybrid apps and possible information leaks via a widely-used advertising platform.</p><p>The bulk of this presentation will focus on ASE 2016 work on analysis of hybrid apps (1), a blend of per-platform native code and portable JavaScript. I will also briefly discuss two other recent projects involving WALA: ASE 2015 work on a practically tunable static analysis framework for large-scale JavaScript applications (2), and ISSTA 2015 work on scalable and precise taint analysis for Android (3).</p><p>1: Sungho Lee, Julian Dolby, Sukyoung Ryu: HybriDroid: static analysis framework for Android hybrid applications.

<span><p>We will present and demonstrate the usefulness of the sequent
calculus as a formal model of computation based on interactions
between producers and consumers of results. This model leads
to a better understanding of call-by-name evaluation by
reconciling the conflicting principles of extensionality and
weak-head evaluation, thus internalizing a known parametricity
result. It allows one to explore two dualities of computation:
the duality between call-by-name and call-by-value, and the
duality between construction and deconstruction. This ultimately
leads to a better linguistic foundation for co-induction as dual
to induction. From a more practical point of view, the sequent
calculus provides a useful inspiration for the design of
intermediate languages.</p></span></p>

<span><p>Consistency is hard and coordination is expensive. As we move into the
world of connected 'Internet of Things' style applications, or
large-scale mobile applications, devices have less power, periods of
limited connectivity, and operate over unreliable asynchronous
networks. This poses a problem with shared state: how do we handle
concurrent operations over shared state, while clients are offline,
and ensure that values converge to a desirable result without making
the system unavailable?</p>
  <p>We look at a new programming model, called Lasp. This programming
model combines distributed convergent data structures with a dataflow
execution model designed for distribution over large-scale
applications. This model supports arbitrary placement of processing
node: this enables the user to author applications that can be
distributed across data centers and pushed to the edge.</p></span></p>

<span><p>Static program analysis is a powerful technique for maintaining software, with applications such as compiler optimizations, code refactoring, and bug finding. Static analyzers are typically implemented in general-purpose programming languages, such as C++ and Java; however, these analyzers are complex and often difficult to understand and maintain. An alternate approach is to use Datalog, a declarative language. Implementors can express analysis constraints declaratively, which makes it easier to understand and ensure correctness of the analysis. Furthermore, the declarative nature of the analysis allows multiple, independent analyses to be easily combined.</p>
<p>Flix is a programming language for static analysis, consisting of a logic language and a functional language. The logic language is inspired by Datalog, but supports user-defined lattices. The functional language allows implementors to write functions, something which is not supported in Datalog. These two extensions, user-defined lattices and functions, allow Flix to support analyses that cannot be expressed by Datalog, such as a constant propagation analysis. Datalog is limited to constraints on relations, and although it can simulate finite lattices, it cannot express lattices over an infinite domain. Finally, another advantage of Flix is that it supports interoperability with existing tools written in general-purpose programming languages.</p>
<p>This talk provides an overview of the implementation and evaluation of the Flix functional language. The implementation involves abstract syntax tree transformations, an interpreter back-end, and a code generator back-end, and must support a number of interesting language features, such as pattern matching, first-class functions, and interoperability. The evaluation compares the interpreter and code generator back-ends in terms of correctness and performance.</p></span></p>

<span><p>The precise semantics of floating-point arithmetic programs depends on the execution platform, including the compiler and the target hardware. Such platform dependencies infringe on the highly desirable goal of software portability (which is in fact promised by heterogeneous computing frameworks like OpenCL): the same program run on the same inputs on different platforms can produce different results. In other words, portability does not guarantee reproducibility, and this is a more or less accepted state of affairs.</p>
<p>Serious doubts on the portability of numeric applications arise when differences in results are behavioral, i.e. when they lead to changes in the control flow of a program. In this talk I will first present an algorithm that takes a numeric procedure and determines whether a given input can lead to different decisions depending merely on how the arithmetic in the procedure is compiled and executed. I will then show how this algorithm can be used in static and dynamic analyses of programs, to estimate their numeric stability.

<span><p>Symbolic execution, which was introduced more than four decades ago, is typically used in software testing to explore as many different program paths as possible in a given amount of time, and for each path to generate a set of concrete input values exercising it, and check for the presence of various kinds of errors including assertion violations, uncaught exceptions, security vulnerabilities, and memory corruption.  A key limitation of classical symbolic execution is that it cannot generate useful test inputs if the program under test uses complex operations such as pointer manipulations and non-linear arithmetic operations.</p>
<p>Our research on Concolic Testing (also known as DART: Directed Automated Random Testing or Dynamic Symbolic Execution) alleviated the limitations of classical symbolic execution by combining concrete execution and symbolic execution.  We demonstrated that concolic testing is an effective technique for generating high-coverage test suites and for finding deep errors in complex software applications. The success of concolic testing in scalably and exhaustively testing real-world software was a major milestone in the ad hoc world of software testing and has inspired the development of several industrial and academic automated testing and security tools.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges of concolic testing is the huge number of programs paths in all but the smallest programs, which is usually exponential in the number of static branches in the code.  In this talk I will describe MultiSE, a new technique for merging states incrementally during symbolic execution, without using auxiliary variables. The key idea of MultiSE is based on an alternative representation of the state, where we map each variable, including the program counter, to a set of guarded symbolic expressions called a value summary. MultiSE has several advantages over conventional symbolic execution and state merging techniques: 1) value summaries enable sharing of symbolic expressions and path constraints along multiple paths, 2) value-summaries avoid redundant execution, 3) MultiSE does not introduce auxiliary symbolic values, which enables it to make progress even when merging values not supported by the constraint solver, such as floating point or function values.  We have implemented MultiSE for JavaScript programs in a publicly available open-source tool. Our evaluation of MultiSE on several programs shows that MultiSE can run significantly faster than traditional symbolic execution.</p></span></p>

<span><p>Aliasing is a known source of challenges in the context of imperative object-oriented languages, which have led to important advances in type systems for aliasing control. However, their large-scale adoption has turned out to be a surprisingly difficult challenge. While new language designs show promise, they do not address the need of aliasing control in existing languages.</p>
<p>This paper presents a new approach to isolation and uniqueness in an existing, widely-used language, Scala. The approach is unique in the way it addresses some of the most important obstacles to the adoption of type system extensions for aliasing control. First, adaptation of existing code requires only a minimal set of annotations. Only a single bit of information is required per class. Surprisingly, the paper shows that this information can be provided by the object-capability discipline, widely-used in program security. We formalize our approach as a type system and prove key soundness theorems. The type system is implemented for the full Scala language, providing, for the first time, a sound integration with Scala’s local type inference. Finally, we empirically evaluate the conformity of existing Scala open-source code on a corpus of over 75,000 LOC.</p></span></p>

<span><p>Julia, like R, is a dynamic language for scientific computing but, unlike R, it was explicitly designed to deliver performance competitive to traditional batch-compiled languages. To achieve this Julia's designers made a number of unusual choices, including the presence of a set of type annotations that are used for dispatching methods and speed up code, but not for type-checking. The result is that many Julia programs are competitive with equivalent programs written in C. This talk gives a brief overview of the key points of Julia's design and considers whether similar ideas could be adopted in R.</p></span></p>

<span><p>A &quot;type refinement system&quot; is a type system built on top of
a typed programming language, as an extra layer of typing.  Over the
past few years Paul-André Melliès and I have investigated a
categorical foundation for type refinement systems, which is based on
the idea of looking at a type refinement system &quot;backwards&quot;, in terms
of the functor which erases the extra layer of types.  The talk will
give an introduction to this framework as well as to some of the
insights that it offers, such as:</p>
<p>* The idea of viewing Hoare logic as a type refinement system</p>
<p>* The importance of the bifibrational operations of &quot;pushing forward&quot; and
  &quot;pulling back&quot; (which generalize strongest postconditions and weakest preconditions)</p>
<p>* How those operations can be combined with a monoidal closed structure, to
  model type refinement systems built over pure lambda calculus</p>
<p>I will not assume any prior background in category theory, although as background reading audience
members may be interested in the lecture notes for my recent course at OPLSS
(<a href="http://noamz.org/oplss16/refinements-notes.pdf&quot;">http://noamz.org/oplss16/refinements-notes.pdf&quot;</a>, especially Ch.3).</p></span></p>

based on a monad that counts abstract steps, controlled by one of the
monadic operations. The monad's computational content, however, is
simply that of the identity monad so programs written in our
monad (that recur on the natural structure of their arguments) extract
into idiomatic OCaml code. We evaluated the expressiveness of the
library by proving that red-black tree insertion and search, merge

<span>This talk reports on some cool ideas I learned during a week-long
seminar in Dagstuhl last month; it will present other people's work,
not my own. It is aimed at an audience interested in programming
language design in general, but not familiar with the theoretical
treatment of pure languages and side-effects.

We shall start with *demos* first, explaining short code examples in
three programming languages: ML with exceptions as a warmup, then the
new language 'Eff' of Matija Pretnar and Andrej Bauer, that first
implemented so-called effect handlers, and finally the language
'Frank' of Conor McBride, that integrates these handlers in a more
uniform style of &quot;effectful call-by-value programming&quot;.

Only second will we discuss some *theory*, in an accessible way:
monads and algebraic effects, which are two distinct ways to formalize
side-effects, and the difference between &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; style
of effectful programming.

Underlying this talk are two larger, important questions of
programming language design, that will be touched during the talk and
we can discuss further afterwards:
- Do programming language need a facility for user-defined side-effects?
- When should we encode new design ideas as libraries/macros in an
  expressive language, and when should we design languages afresh for
  them?</span></p>

<span>The domain of Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly expanding beyond research and becoming a major industrial market with such stakeholders as major manufacturers of chips and connected objects, and fast-growing operators of low-power wide-area networks. Importantly, this emerging domain is driven by applications that leverage the infrastructure to provide users with innovative, high-value services. Because of this application-centric approach, software development plays a key role to realize the full potential of IoT.

In this talk, we argue that there is a continuum between orchestrating connected objects in the small and in the large, fostering a unified approach to application development. We examine the requirements for orchestrating connected objects and address them with domain-specific design concepts. We then show how to map these design concepts into dedicated programming patterns and runtime mechanisms.

Our work revolves around domain-specific notations integrated into a tool-based design methodology, dedicated to develop IoT applications. We have applied our work across a spectrum of infrastructure sizes; we present examples, ranging from an automated pilot in avionics, to an assisted living platform for the home of seniors, to a parking management system in a smart city.</span></p>

<span>The optimization component of a compiler takes a program as input and
produces another, hopefully faster, program as output.  At a high level,
optimizers solve a search problem over a space of programs, but the
traditional architecture of a compiler's optimizer does no search at
all.  This talk will present the STOKE project, which is exploring the
use of Monte Carlo search methods as the basis of a modern compiler
optimizer.  We will show that search-based program optimization can
consistently improve, sometimes substantially, on current production
compilers at their highest levels of optimization and can even compete

<span>Object capabilities are a technique for fine-grained privilege separation in programming languages and systems,with important applications in security. However, current formal characterisations do not fully capture capability-safety of a programming language and are not sufficient for verifying typical applications. Using state-of-the-art techniques from programming languages research, we define a logical relation for a core calculus of JavaScript that better characterises capability-safety. The relation is powerful enough to reason about typical capability patterns and supports evolvable invariants on shared data structures, capabilities with restricted authority over them and isolated components with restricted communication channels. We use a novel notion of effect parametricity for deriving properties about effects. We demonstrate that our results imply memory access bounds that have previously been used to characterise capability-safety.</span></p>

<span>Emerging consumer electronics products are running the same software platforms that power smartphones. This leads to the appealing idea that a uniform programming abstraction can be used for app development for a range of devices, from wearables to smartphones. In practice, however, devices wary in their hardware capabilities and this has an impact on app development. In this talk, I will focus on ways in which JavaScript may be used and/or run differently to accommodate the different hardware capabilities across devices. Specifically, I will present a subset of JavaScript that strikes a balance between retaining the flavor of JavaScript (e.g. use of prototype inheritance, no explicit type declarations) and the possibility of ahead-of-time compilation to efficient code.</span></p>

<span>Analyzing real-world web applications is a challenging task. On top of understanding the semantics of JavaScript, it requires modeling of web documents, platform objects, and interactions between them. Most web applications load JavaScript code dynamically, which makes pure static analysis approaches inapplicable. In this talk, we present our journey to analyze JavaScript web applications in the wild using various approaches. From pure JavaScript programs to JavaScript web applications using platform-specific libraries, we explain technical challenges in analyzing each of them and how we built an open-source analysis framework for JavaScript, SAFE, that addresses the challenges incrementally.  Finally, we discuss our ongoing work on analysis of Android hybrid applications.</span></p>

<span><p>Multiprocessors and concurrent programming are now pervasive. Typically, they do not guarantee sequential consistency (a.k.a. interleaving semantics), which is the standard assumption by most work on semantics and verification. Instead, they employ subtle memory models, exposing unexpected relaxed behaviors arising from hardware and compiler optimizations.</p>

<span><p>Weak memory models formalize the inconsistent behaviors that one can observe in multithreaded programs running on modern hardware. In so doing, they complicate the already-difficult task of reasoning about correctness of concurrent code. Worse, they render impotent most formal methods that have been developed to tame concurrency, which almost universally assume a strong (i.e., sequentially consistent) memory model. In response, we have developed a number of alternative reasoning techniques that are sound for programs running weak memory consistency. I will cover both program logics, such as relaxed separation logic, as well as theorems that allow reducing reasoning about well-structured weakly consistent implementations down to sequential consistency, and show how these can be applied to reason about a practical RCU implementation.</p></span></p>

<span><p>Compilers form an integral component of the software
development ecosystem. Compiler writers must understand the
specification of source and target languages to design sophisticated
algorithms that transform programs while preserving
semantics. Unfortunately, compiler bugs in mainstream compilers are
common. Compiler bugs can manifest as crashes during compilation, or,
much worse, result in the silent generation of incorrect
programs. Such mis-compilations can introduce subtle errors that are
difficult to diagnose and generally puzzling to software
developers.</p>
<p>The talk will describe the problems in developing peephole
optimizations that perform local rewriting to improve the efficiency
of LLVM code. These optimizations are individually difficult to get
right, particularly in the presence of undefined behavior; taken
together they represent a persistent source of bugs.  The talk will
present Alive, a domain-specific language for writing optimizations
and for automatically either proving them correct or else generating
counterexamples.  A transformation in Alive is shown to be correct
automatically by encoding the transformation into constraints, which
are automatically checked for validity using a Satisfiability Modulo
Theory (SMT) solver. Furthermore, Alive can be automatically
translated into C++ code that is suitable for inclusion in an LLVM
optimization pass.</p>
<p>Alive is based on an attempt to balance usability and formal
methods; for example, it captures—but largely hides—the detailed
semantics of three different kinds of undefined behavior in LLVM. We
have translated more than 300 LLVM optimizations into Alive and, in
the process, found that eight of them were wrong.  I will conclude the
talk highlighting the lessons learned and the challenges in
incorporating lightweight formal methods in the tool-chain of the
compiler developer.</p></span></p>

<span><p>Performance clearly matters to users. The most common software update
on the AppStore *by far* is &quot;Bug fixes and performance enhancements.&quot;
Now that Moore's Law Free Lunch has ended, programmers have to work
hard to get high performance for their applications. But why is
performance so hard to deliver?</p>
<p> I will first explain why our current approaches to evaluating and
 optimizing performance don't work, especially on modern hardware and
 for modern applications. I will then present two systems that address
 these challenges. Stabilizer is a tool that enables statistically
 sound performance evaluation, making it possible to understand the
 impact of optimizations and conclude things like the fact that the -O2
 and -O3 optimization levels are indistinguishable from noise
 (unfortunately true).</p>
<p> Since compiler optimizations have largely run out of steam, we need
 better profiling support, especially for modern concurrent,
 multi-threaded applications. Coz is a novel &quot;causal profiler&quot; that
 lets programmers optimize for throughput or latency, and which
 pinpoints and accurately predicts the impact of optimizations. Coz's
 approach unlocks numerous previously unknown optimization
 opportunities. Guided by Coz, we improved the performance of Memcached
 by 9%, SQLite by 25%, and accelerated six Parsec applications by as
 much as 68%; in most cases, these optimizations involved modifying
 under 10 lines of code.</p>

<span>            <p>Computer networks do not simply connect machines together, but run several
         applications on network devices, such as load balancers, intrusion detection
         systems, authentication portals, and more. Historically, these applications were
         black-boxes running on proprietary hardware, but software-defined networking
         (SDN) now allows anyone to write their own programs using open networking
         protocols (e.g., OpenFlow). So, what are the right abstractions for programming networks? This talk will try
         to address this question in three ways.</p>
                        <p>First, we present a syntactic theory of network forwarding called NetKAT, which supports equational reasoning about network-wide behavior. Using NetKAT, programmers can ask and answer questions like, &quot;Can A communicate with B?&quot;,
                        &quot;Does all traffic traverse my intrusion detection system?&quot;, &quot;Is there a loop in
my network?&quot;, and so on.</p>
<p>Second, we present a fast and efficient compiler for NetKAT. Although several
network compilers already exist, they are unusable on even moderately sized
networks. Using new data structures and compilation algorithms, our new compiler
is two orders of magnitudes faster than prior work and scales to large
datacenter networks.</p>
<p>Finally, we consider the problem of building a reliable runtime system for
NetKAT. NetKAT abstracts away several low-level details of networking hardware.
Although this is a boon for the network programmer, the burden now shifts to us
to engineer abstractions correctly. We present a Coq-certified runtime system
that is proven correct with respect to a detailed operational model software-
defined networks.</p></span></p>

   in the face of network partitions and processor failures results in
   implementations that provide only weak (so-called eventually consistent)

   Applications must be carefully constructed to be aware of unwanted
   inconsistencies permitted by such implementations (e.g., having negative

                                                      objects of these types), and a contract enforcement system to analyze
                                                      contracts and automatically generate the appropriate consistency protocol

                                                      programmers to reason compositionally about consistency from the perspective

<span> <span> This talk is about scalloc, a fast, multicore-scalable, low-fragmentation memory allocator and selfie, a 4000-line implementation of a tiny self-compiling C compiler and a tiny self-executing MIPS emulator for teaching systems engineering. Scalloc is a typical example of a very complex, multi-year research effort while selfie is, at least for now, a purely educational, many-year effort in teaching compiler, operating system, and virtual machine design based on a single, highly principled software platform. So far scalloc and selfie only share the passion of their authors and are otherwise two distinct projects. Yet earlier versions of selfie, before they were even identified as such, were instrumental in bringing up the generation of students who did scalloc.
The main ideas behind scalloc are: uniform treatment of small and big objects through so-called virtual spans, efficiently and effectively reclaiming free memory through fast and scalable global data structures, and constant-time (modulo synchronization) allocation and deallocation operations that trade off memory reuse and spatial locality without being subject to false sharing. The main ideas behind selfie are: a compiler written in and for a tiny subset of C called C* which uses the dereferencing * operator of C for memory access but lacks data structures and many other features and a MIPS emulator written in C* that can execute itself. Both are combined and extended by students to do very cool stuff.</span></span></p>

<div class="pn-abstract-bio"><p><span class="pn-title-2">Abstract</span>
<span><span>  Memory corruption plagues systems since the dawn of computing. With the
rise of defense techniques like stack cookies, ASLR, and DEP, attacks
have become much more complicated, yet control-flow hijack attacks are
still prevalent. Attacks leverage code reuse attacks, often using some
form of information disclosure. Stronger defense mechanisms have been
proposed but none have seen wide deployment so far (i) due to the time
it takes to deploy a security mechanism, (ii) incompatibility with
specific features, and (iii) most severely due to performance overhead.
In the talk, we evaluate the security benefits and limitations of the
status quo and look into upcoming defense mechanisms (and their attacks).

Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) are two of
the hottest upcoming defense mechanisms. CFI guarantees that the runtime
control flow follows the statically determined control-flow graph. An
attacker may reuse any of the valid transitions at any control flow
transfer. CPI on the other hand is a dynamic property that enforces
memory safety guarantees like bounds checks for code pointers by
separating code pointers from regular data. We will discuss differences
and advantages/disadvantages of both approaches, especially the security
benefits they give under novel attacks like Counterfeit Object-Oriented
Programming (COOP) and Control-Flow Bending (CFB).  COOP reuses complete
functions as gadgets and CFB bends the control flow along valid but
unintended paths in the control-flow graph of a program.

<span><span>      Modern verification techniques are becoming
ever-more powerful and sophisticated, and building tools to implement
them is a time-consuming and difficult task. Writing a new verifier to
validate each on-paper approach is impractical; for this reason
intermediate verification languages such as Boogie and Why3 have become
popular over the last decade. However, verification approaches geared
around complex program logics (such as separation logic) have typically
been implemented in specialised tools, since the reasoning is hard to
map down to first-order automated reasoning. In practice, this means
that a rich variety of modern techniques have no corresponding tool
support.  In this talk, I will present the new Silver intermediate
verification language, which has been designed to facilitate the
lightweight implementation of a variety of modern methodologies for
program verification. In contrast to lower-level verification languages,
Silver provides native support for heap reasoning; modes of reasoning
such as concurrent separation logic, dynamic frames and
rely-guarantee/invariants can be simply encoded.  Silver has been
developed as part of the Viper project, which provides two automated
back-end verifiers for Silver programs. Since releasing our software in
September last year, it has been used for (internal and external)
projects to build tools for Java verification, non-blocking concurrency
reasoning, flow-sensitive typing and reasoning about GPU and Linux
kernel code.</span></span></p>

<div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h2>Programming Language Seminar, Junior</h2>
<p>The junior PL seminar (<a href="http://lists.ccs.neu.edu/pipermail/pl-sem-jr">mailing list</a>) (<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/stamourv/pljr.html">home page</a>): a regular student-only seminar, suitable for those new to the study of programming languages.</p>
<br />
<p>The PL Seminar, Jr. is a seminar where students new to the area can discuss the study of programming languages. This seminar is not intended to replace the main PL Seminar, but we hope that it can augment that by providing a place where junior students can discuss topics and ask questions at a pace better suited to our level of knowledge. Topics include:
<ul><li>Design and analysis of programming languages: syntax, semantics, pragmatics (ie, how do you use a language feature in real programs?)</li>
<li>Implementation of programming languages</li>
<li>Program development, both large and small</li>
<li>Programming pedagogy</li>
<li>Programming tools and environments</li>
<li>and anything else that catches our interest.</li></ul>
Topics are not limited to current research, but include older papers, textbook chapters, and surveys.</p>
<br />
<h4>Why PL Seminar, Jr.?</h4>
<small><p>In many ways, the existing PL Seminar doesn't serve junior students well. For us, it is intended to provide an environment where we can go to listen to current research. While nobody expects us to understand the entire presentation, we would ideally be able to say, &quot;I didn't understand that, but it sounded really neat.&quot; By and large, that hasn't happened, for a number of reasons:
<ul><li>For many of us, once our level of comprehension drops below a certain threshold, we tend to get frustrated and tune out. It's very difficult to say that something sounds interesting when you don't even feel like you understand the language.</li>
<li>The discussion environment isn't really helpful to junior students. The questions from the audience are typically research-oriented; often, a great deal of background knowledge is required to follow the ensuing discussions.</li>
<li>To overuse a metaphor, the bandwidth available for discussion tends to be filled by a relatively small number of people; it's often difficult for a junior student to get a word in edgewise.</li></ul></p></small>
<br />
<h4>Seminar Culture</h4>

<small><p>For this seminar to be as useful as possible, it is important we establish the right &quot;seminar culture.&quot; This is, of course, something that is hard to describe, and it will shift and evolve. However, there are some guidelines for what we are trying to accomplish:
<ul><li>Attendees are willing to learn and to help others learn. They should not come in order to demonstrate how much smarter they are than everyone else just because they know so much more about a specific topic.</li>
<li>Active listening is encouraged. Ask questions! In particular, while research questions are of course welcome, basic comprehension questions are especially encouraged. If you don't understand something, or if you don't believe a step in a proof, ask!</li>
<li>An important corollary: no question is too stupid to ask. This places an obligation on other members of the seminar: rather than express frustration at the basic nature of a question, look at it as an opportunity to practice your skills in explaining things.</li>
<li>Of course, while active listening is a good thing, we want to avoid having a few people fill the communications channel. So, please be considerate of the other people present and allow them to join the discussions as well.</li></ul>
<p>Any attendee may propose a topic; we'll solicit volunteers to present a survey of the area. We expect that most of the presenters will be junior PL students, although outside presentations are welcome.</p></p></small></div></div></div></div></div></div>
