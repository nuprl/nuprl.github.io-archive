   <description>
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I attended the first &lt;a href="https://pliss2017.github.io/"&gt;Programming Language Implementation Summer School&lt;/a&gt;, held in beautiful Bertinoro, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of PLISS was &amp;ldquo;to prepare early graduate students and advanced undergraduates for research in the field,&amp;rdquo; and I think it successfully accomplished that. There were many talks in a variety of areas, such as just-in-time compilers, garbage collection, static analysis, and distributed systems. But PLISS was more than just a series of talks: PLISS provided an environment for interacting with other students as well as senior researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-talks"&gt;The Talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the amount of technical content at PLISS, there was easily something for everyone. &lt;a href="http://janvitek.org/"&gt;Jan Vitek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tratt.net/laurie/"&gt;Laurence Tratt&lt;/a&gt; gave lectures that included hands-on exercises where we worked on JITs. &lt;a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/"&gt;Suresh Jagannathan&lt;/a&gt; dived into the operational semantics of a distributed system, so we could reason about different weak consistency models. Francesco Logozzo gave us a whirlwind tour of abstract interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my favorite talks included some form of extra content, such as exercises, live-coding presentations, or demos. I found it really helpful to write actual code and apply what I had just learned, or to look at some concrete examples. The examples and exercises also helped with the pacing, as actively listening to four 90-minute talks every day is exhausting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, these were some of my favorite talks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Programming Language Implementation with LLVM&lt;/strong&gt;, by Petr Maj, Oli  Flückiger, and &lt;a href="http://janvitek.org/"&gt;Jan Vitek&lt;/a&gt;. As the first talk of the summer school, this  was a gentle introduction for the rest of the week. We had &lt;a href="https://github.com/PRL-PRG/pliss-rift/"&gt;exercises&lt;/a&gt;  (with intentional bugs to make us think!), and also brief overviews of  intermediate languages, static analysis, and garbage collection. These three  topics would later show up in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micro Virtual Machines&lt;/strong&gt;, by &lt;a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/"&gt;Steve Blackburn&lt;/a&gt;. This talk covered  background information on virtual machines, and also the &lt;a href="http://microvm.github.io/"&gt;Micro VM&lt;/a&gt;  project that Steve&amp;rsquo;s group has been working on. A lot of the material was  already familiar to me, but I still enjoyed the talk, and even got a few  ideas for the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;, by &lt;a href="http://matt.might.net/"&gt;Matt Might&lt;/a&gt;. Matt&amp;rsquo;s talk was based on one of  his &lt;a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/intro-static-analysis/"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; and an older talk he&amp;rsquo;s given. Impressively, the entire  example was live-coded, with only a single mistake!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Language Implementations&lt;/strong&gt;, by &lt;a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/"&gt;Alastair Donaldson&lt;/a&gt;. This was  an entertaining talk, since Ally showed multiple examples of crashing  compilers, and causing other kinds of mischief by triggering compiler bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re disappointed that you couldn&amp;rsquo;t see these talks, don&amp;rsquo;t worry! The talks were recorded and will be posted very shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-people"&gt;The People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s more to PLISS than the talks. I&amp;rsquo;m referring to &lt;em&gt;networking&lt;/em&gt;, or the opportunity to get out and talk to other people about research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an early graduate student, I&amp;rsquo;ve been given a lot of advice about talking to people at conferences and the importance of the &amp;ldquo;hallway track.&amp;rdquo; I still have difficulty doing this at an actual conference, like &lt;a href="http://pldi17.sigplan.org/home"&gt;PLDI&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://2017.ecoop.org/"&gt;ECOOP&lt;/a&gt;. When there are hundreds of attendees, or when people already know each other and are in conversation groups, I find it difficult to approach them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not the case at PLISS. There were fewer attendees: about fifty students and a dozen speakers. There was a good mix of undergraduate, master&amp;rsquo;s, first-year PhD, and more senior PhD students. All our breakfasts, lunches, and breaks were together, so we would see the same people again and again, and inevitably start to learn each other&amp;rsquo;s names. The speakers would also be among us, and there was a good ratio of speakers to students for discussions and mealtime mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had many opportunities to practice my &amp;ldquo;research pitch.&amp;rdquo; I talked to senior students and got advice. I talked to junior students and gave advice. Two different people I talked to about my research pointed me to the same paper to read. I found another student who was working with &lt;a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/wpis/papers/popl95.pdf"&gt;IFDS&lt;/a&gt;, an algorithm I have spent much time trying to understand. And, one day at lunch, my table discovered that we were all working on static analysis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I enjoyed the talks, I think the best part of PLISS was meeting and talking to other people. You can replace talks with videos (but you lose the speaker-audience interaction), and you can replace conversations with other forms of communication. But there isn&amp;rsquo;t really anything that can replace the serendipity of bumping into someone with a shared interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-location"&gt;The Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; best part of PLISS was the location. Italy is a beautiful country with delicious food. And Bertinoro is a small town on the top of a hill, with a breathtaking view of the surrounding area. The lectures were held in a &lt;a href="https://pliss2017.github.io/images/pics/7.jpg"&gt;castle at the top of the hill&lt;/a&gt; (photo credit: Steve Blackburn). The speakers lived in the castle for the week, while the students lived in the former monastery (seems fitting), which has been renovated into a university residence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my two favorite pictures I took (click for full size):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/img/pliss2017-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/pliss2017-1-thumb.jpg" alt="View from the castle" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/img/pliss2017-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/pliss2017-2-thumb.jpg" alt="Panorama" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Blackburn has more pictures posted on the &lt;a href="https://pliss2017.github.io/"&gt;PLISS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLISS was a wonderful event. Many thanks need to be given to the speakers, organizers, and sponsors, for making this possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If and when there is a second PLISS, I highly encourage students to apply! You will learn a lot from the lectures, from talking to the speakers, and meeting other students. And if it&amp;rsquo;s in Bertinoro again, you can enjoy the weather and nice view!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>

   <title>Tracing JITs for Dynamic Languages</title>

&lt;p&gt;Traditional JIT (just-in-time) compilers are method-based: they compile &amp;ldquo;hot&amp;rdquo; (i.e. frequently executed) methods to native code. An alternative is trace-based or tracing JITs, where the compilation unit is a (hot) sequence of instructions. Typically, such sequences of instructions correspond to loops, where programs spend most of their execution time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did the idea of tracing come from? What was appealing about it? How was tracing adapted for JITs and dynamic languages? What happened to Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s TraceMonkey, which used to be part of Firefox? Do any JITs today use tracing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I trace tracing JITs from their origins to some of their recent developments. I cover five papers: the original tracing paper, an implementation of a tracing JIT for Java, the TraceMonkey JIT for JavaScript, PyPy&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;meta-level&amp;rdquo; tracing, and a specific class of optimizations for tracing JITs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The idea of using the phrase &amp;ldquo;trace tracing JITs&amp;rdquo; is from Matthias Felleisen.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All materials can be found in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nuprl/hopl-s2017/tree/master/tracing-jit"&gt;course repository&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fall 2016 PL Junior Retrospective</title>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/seminars.html"&gt;Programming Language Seminar, Junior&lt;/a&gt; (or “PL Junior”), is a seminar for junior students to learn and discuss topics at a pace more suitable to our background. This semester, we decided to study dependent types. We chose this topic because&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;working from the &lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/types-and-programming-languages"&gt;TAPL&lt;/a&gt; presentation of type systems, dependent types are a step up in difficulty (excepting F-omega-sub), and&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;they represent a significant increase in the reasoning power of types over programs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;!-- more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a preference for learning how to implement a dependent type system, instead of spending a significant amount of time reading papers, especially dense type-theoretic papers suggested by &lt;a href="http://purelytheoretical.com/sywtltt.html"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/posts/2015-08-14-learn-tt.html"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;. So we followed the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sweirich/pi-forall"&gt;pi-for-all&lt;/a&gt; lecture series given by Stephanie Weirich at &lt;a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/attapl/"&gt;OPLSS&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on implementing a simple dependently-typed programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the pi-for-all lectures, we read chapter two of Edwin Brady’s &lt;a href="https://eb.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/writings/thesis.pdf"&gt;dissertation on implementing dependently typed languages&lt;/a&gt;. The thesis includes a relatively approachable introduction to TT, the core dependent type theory of Epigram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we became sidetracked by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_U#Girard.27s_paradox"&gt;Girard’s paradox&lt;/a&gt;. In the first pi-for-all lecture, we came across the Type-in-Type rule. (In a dependent type system the term and the type languages are the same. However, we still need to distinguish what is a “program” and what is a “type,” for instance, so that we can determine that the annotation of a function’s argument is valid. So a construct in the term language is Type, which is meant to describe those things that are valid in programs where we expect to find a type). In the lecture, this prompted the comment that this (“of course”) makes our system inconsistent as a logic, but there was no further elaboration, and we could not figure out how to use this fact to show inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out the reason Type-in-Type is inconsistent is quite complicated. It is explained in a &lt;a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kw/scans/hurkens95tlca.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that we had difficulty understanding. So we turned to the students in our lab that have expertise in the area. The answer we received is that, intuitively, it is inconsistent for the same reason as Russell’s paradox (or the Burali-Forti paradox), but the actual proof is actually quite involved. The lesson we drew is that despite being “obvious,” Type-in-Type being inconsistent is not easy to prove. The way people seem to throw around this conclusion is confusing from a beginner’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about the pi-for-all series is that it demystified dependent types for us. We gained confidence in being able to whiteboard a dependent type system with the ease of System-F or STLC. If we had one complaint, the presentation of the material relied heavily on Haskell details. The unbound library to handle variables in the implementation results in a somewhat “magicy” representation of binding; it’s not clear that the benefits are so great as to outweigh the cost of just implementing alpha-equivalence and capture-avoiding-substitution. Overall they were high-quality lectures. As hinted above, we didn’t particularly care for the second lecture that was mostly a code walk-through. One advantage of watching videos was that we could speed through parts we were already comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Edwin Brady’s dissertation, we got a glimpse of how quickly the details of a dependently typed language get hairy. Looking at you, inductive data definitions and eliminations. There were some extremely large type signatures. While this exercise boosted our confidence that we could read Serious Dependent Types™ papers, it also gave evidence that our fears of incomprehensibility were not completely unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue appeared before in our discussion of Girard’s Paradox. In the discussion of the paradox, we got stuck when we tried to understand the very complex term that inhabited the bottom type. Dependent typing, and discussions thereof, allow very rich, meaningful, and complex types that are as complex as the code that they abstract over. While we are used to understanding these structures in code, parsing a complex type and its fundamental meaning gave us considerable difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-the-format"&gt;Thoughts on the format&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our meetings this semester were all of the form “we’ll watch this lecture or read this chapter, and then discuss it next week.” Next semester we would like to go back to presenting each week. We feel doing presentations forces the presenter to reach a deeper understanding of the material. This semester we got a relatively shallow understanding of a broad area. A deeper understanding with a narrower focus may be more beneficial (or complementary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[Sam’s defense as Grand Convener of PL Junior: Once we picked dependent types as a topic, doing presentations was not an option. We didn’t have the expertise in the area to pick out different sub-topics and papers suitable for presentations. And, since we were short-handed (4 people each week), we would be presenting once a month!]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we continue learning more about dependent types it would be by: 1) Doing more reading, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/attapl/"&gt;ATTAPL&lt;/a&gt; chapter or the programming in Martin-Löf’s type theory material. 2) Actually trying to implement some of the things we’ve learned this semester 3) Playing around with more of the various dependent type systems and theorem provers out there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future pl junior cohorts or anyone else in learning about dependent types: Pi-for-all is useful material, but could be condensed into two weeks (for example, by watching the lectures at 1.5x speed) instead of four. Don’t worry about Type-in-Type. The Epigram material is OK but you might be better served looking at ATTAPL first. At some point, you will have to read the dense papers, but pi-for-all is a good introduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
